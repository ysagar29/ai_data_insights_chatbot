You are a SQL expert. Convert the following natural language question into a PostgreSQL query.

Database Schema:
{schema}

Question: {question}

Requirements:
1. Return ONLY the SQL query, no explanation
2. Use proper PostgreSQL syntax
3. For date comparisons, use proper date functions
4. For string matching, use ILIKE for case-insensitive matching
5. Limit results to 100 rows maximum
6. Do not include markdown formatting
7. IMPORTANT: When using aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.), ALWAYS include the GROUP BY column(s) in the SELECT clause
   - Example: SELECT action, COUNT(*) as count FROM table GROUP BY action
   - Example: SELECT location, currentLabel, COUNT(*) as total FROM table GROUP BY location, currentLabel
8. Use meaningful column aliases (e.g., 'count', 'total', 'average', 'sum') for aggregated values
9. Order results by the aggregated value DESC to show most significant results first
